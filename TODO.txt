Milestone #1: Release to CRAN ⚠

    Hello, would it be possible to add rsdmx package?
    rsdmx offers an interface to web-data provided through SDMX web-services. I've seen that you already listed RJSDMX, rsdmx is alternative to it. Since the goal is the same (while list of data providers slightly differs between the 2 
    packages), i prefer asking in a ticket first on how you would mention rsdmx (maybe avoid redundancy in package description). Thanks in advance!

↑121: Clean up package lead, remove data sharing packages
@ashander opened this pull request 341 days ago.  [open] 

    Work on #114 to focus this task view, as Achim suggested,
    on web-based open data resources. Remove the Data Sharing and
    Archiving section and up date the lede text to describe narrower
    focus.


#114: Proposed division of Task View
@leeper opened this issue 376 days ago.  [open] (7 comments)
[enhancement]
Milestone #1: Release to CRAN ⚠

    I would propose we do the following in order to get this onto CRAN:
    1. [x] Approach Max Kuhn who maintains [the Reproducible Research Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) and see if we could move the key packages from the [Data Sharing and 
    Archiving](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata#data-sharing-and-archiving) section to that Task View. (Many of these are mentioned on Web Technologies, as well.)
    2. [x] Focus this task view, [as Achim suggested](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/issues/4#issuecomment-145132671), only on web-based open data resources.
       - [x] Update the lede text to describe narrower focus
       - [x] Try to organize existing, longer sections (e.g., [Earth Science](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/#earth-science) and [Ecology](https://github.com/ropensci/opendata/#ecological-and-evolutionary-biology)) so that 
    resources are subcategorized.
    3. [x] Document licensing of the various data resources as discussed previously in #4.
    4. [x] Creating and publicizing a package that simply subsets  available.packages()  to be able to describe the universe of data-only packages available on CRAN. (It would not import them, just have tools for drawing peoples' 
    attention to data-specific packages.)
    
    Thoughts, @ashander @sckott?


#97: Standardize line ending behavior
@ashander opened this issue 421 days ago.  [open] (8 comments)
[bug]

    As illustrated in #96 an otherwise helpful pull request can be jammed up by line endings. We can fix this for the repository in general as outlined here https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/
    but I'm not sure what's best practice. @leeper or @sckott have you dealt with this issue in other ropensci repos?
